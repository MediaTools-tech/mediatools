## üõ† Installation & Setup

**‚ùì What if I skip downloading yt-dlp and ffmpeg?**  
**yt-dlp:** The application cannot function without yt-dlp. You have two options:
- Either allow the application to automatically download yt-dlp when prompted
- Or manually download yt-dlp from [yt-dlp official repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and place the executable in the `bin/` folder

**FFmpeg:** The application can work without FFmpeg, but with limitations:
- Format 'b' (pre-merged streams) will work without FFmpeg, though these may not offer the best available quality
- Video merging (bestvideo+bestaudio) requires FFmpeg
- Format conversion requires FFmpeg
- Advanced features like post-processing require FFmpeg

**‚ùì How to fix "yt-dlp not found" error?**  
1. App ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Reset to defaults, Restart App
2. Allow app to download yt-dlp automatically
3. **Manual solution:**
   - Download yt-dlp from the [official releases page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases)
   - Place the executable (`yt-dlp` or `yt-dlp.exe`) in the `bin/` folder
   - Restart the application

## ‚ö° Download Performance

**‚ùì What download speed should I set?**  
**‚úÖ 5M (5 Mbps) is recommended for most users because:**
- Conservative: Unlikely to be blocked by servers
- Stable: Provides consistent download performance
- Network-friendly: Doesn't monopolize your internet connection
- Reliable: Works well with most hosting platforms

**‚ùå Higher speeds (10M-20M) may work but risk:**
- Server blocking: Some platforms detect and block high-speed downloads
- IP throttling: Your IP might be temporarily limited

Adjust based on your: Internet plan, network stability, and target platform policies.

**‚ùì Can I change the download folder?**  
Yes. Go to Settings ‚Üí Download Path and select a new folder. Make sure you have write permission to that location.

**‚ùì Why does progress bar run multiple times for a single video download?**  
This is normal behavior indicating separate component downloads:
1. Video stream - Main video content
2. Audio stream - Separate audio track
3. Thumbnail - Video preview image
4. Metadata - Video information

The application downloads these components then merges them into the final file.

## ‚ùì Why does download fail when the platform is supported by yt-dlp and I can see the video in my browser?

This is a common issue that can happen for several reasons:

### üîí Platform Anti-Bot Measures
**Many platforms actively block automated downloads:**
- Uses sophisticated bot detection
- May throttle downloads from certain IP ranges
- Require cookies from a logged-in session
- May need authentication or has rate limits

**Solution**: 
- **Update yt-dlp** (if Auto-Update is disabled in settings)
- **Provide browser profile path** in Settings (recommended - use your actual browser session profile path)
- **Use cookies.txt file** (advanced users only - be aware of security risks when sharing cookies)

## üîÑ Queue & Session Management

**‚ùì Why is my queue from previous session not showing up?**  
Ensure "Multisession queue support" is enabled:
1. Go to Settings
2. Enable "Multisession queue support"
3. Restart the application

This feature must be enabled to preserve your download queue between sessions.

**‚ùì Why does Windows Explorer slow down with download folder?**  
This can occur when partially downloaded files accumulate:

**Cause:** With multisession support enabled, paused and ignored/skipped downloads create temporary files

**Solution:**
1. Complete or cancel pending downloads
2. Manually clean the download folder periodically
3. The application includes robust cleanup, but manual intervention may be needed for skipped downloads

## üìÅ Format & Container Issues

**‚ùì Which format should I choose?**
- **MKV:** Highest quality, supports pause/resume, better for archival
- **MP4:** Best compatibility (phones, tablets, social media), smaller file sizes
- **Single best (b):** Fastest download, no merging required, but may compromise on quality

**‚ùì Why are MKV files bigger?**  
MKV files are often bigger because they are commonly used to store the highest quality video and audio available, including lossless audio tracks. MP4 files are more focused on broad compatibility and are typically compressed more for smaller file sizes.

**‚ùì Why is pause/resume not supported for MP4 format?**  
Technical limitation of MP4 container:
- **MKV:** Supports true pause/resume at any point
- **MP4:** The MP4 container format doesn't support efficient resuming of partial downloads like MKV does. Resuming MP4 downloads often requires re-downloading significant portions
- **MP4:** Can only resume from certain checkpoints

**‚ùì How can I pause playlist download with MP4 as pause isn't supported?**  
You can pause (functionally), with caveats (With - Multisession queue support):
- With MP4 merge format, Playlist progress is saved between sessions (exit and restart)
- Already downloaded videos will not be downloaded again when you restart downloader
- Only last partially downloaded video (at exit time) will be downloaded again to continue playlist download

Ensure: "Multisession queue support" is enabled. The application will remember your position in the playlist and only overwrite the currently downloading video if interrupted.

**‚ùì Why isn't thumbnail showing for MKV files?**  
MKV thumbnails require external system support:
- **Windows:** Install [Icaros](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/icaros.html) to enable MKV thumbnail previews in File Explorer
- **Linux:** Most modern file managers (Nautilus, Dolphin) support MKV thumbnails natively
- **Note:** This is a Windows Explorer limitation, not an application issue. The thumbnails are embedded correctly in the files.

## üîß Advanced Topics

**‚ùì Why are some videos downloading slowly despite fast internet?**  
**Common causes:**
1. Server limitations: Source platform may throttle downloads
2. Geographic restrictions: Content delivery network delays
3. Format availability: Higher quality formats may have limited bandwidth
4. Network congestion: Other devices/applications using bandwidth

**Solutions:**
- Try different quality settings
- Use download speed limiting to avoid detection
- Download during off-peak hours

**‚ùì Why do some downloads fail with "Unsupported URL"?**  
**Possible reasons:**
1. Platform not supported by yt-dlp
2. Regional restrictions on the content
3. Private/age-restricted content requiring cookies
4. Temporary server issues on the source platform

Check: The [yt-dlp supported sites list](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md) for platform compatibility.

**‚ùì What if the app shows "Permission denied"?**  
- **On Linux/macOS:** Make sure the download path and temp folder are writable:  
  `chmod -R 755 ~/Videos`
- **On Windows:** Run the app as administrator

**‚ùì How do I clean up stuck temp files?**  
If the app closes unexpectedly, leftover .part files may remain. The app tries to remove them on exit, but you can safely delete them manually from the temp/ folder.

**‚ùì Where are logs stored?**  
You can find the latest session logs in the data/ folder. Include this file when reporting issues.

**‚ùì Can I use my own yt-dlp or FFmpeg binaries?**  
Yes. Place your custom builds inside the bin/ folder with the same names (yt-dlp, ffmpeg). The app automatically detects and uses them.

**‚ùì How do I use cookies for private videos?**  
In Settings, specify the path to your cookies.txt file or enable "Cookies from Browser." This enables downloading of age-restricted or private content.

**‚ùì I deleted desktop shortcut, how can I get it back?**  
**Quick Solution - Reset First Run:**  
Close the Video Downloader application completely

**Windows:**
- Right-click on `mt-vdl.exe`
- Select "Send to" ‚Üí "Desktop (create shortcut)"
- **Or**
- Navigate to the application folder ‚Üí `data/`
- Delete the file called `first_run.flag`
- Restart the application - it will prompt to create the desktop shortcut

**If not Windows OS:**
- Navigate to the application folder ‚Üí `data/`
- Delete the file `./mediatools` (`rm ~/.mediatools`)
- Restart the application - it will prompt to create the desktop shortcut
