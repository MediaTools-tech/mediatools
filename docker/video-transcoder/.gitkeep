# Create these empty .gitkeep files in the respective directories
# to ensure the directories are tracked by git but their contents are ignored

# storage/uploads/.gitkeep
# (empty file)

# storage/outputs/.gitkeep
# (empty file)

# storage/temp/.gitkeep
# (empty file)

# These files allow git to track the directory structure
# while ignoring the actual uploaded/transcoded videos
